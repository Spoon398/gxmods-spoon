This mod uses some exported sounds from the Xbox 360 NXE Dashboard, which was used
from around 2007/2008 to 2011, when the Metro dashboard was introduced.
Included in v1.0 of this mod is:
- Keyboard sounds
- Sound effects
Planned additions are:
- Custom animated background
- Correctly formatted CSS theme

KNOWN BUGS:
- Click sound doesn't work properly for some reason. I think due to the length of it
being under a second, it's going crazy.
- Setting the volume to 200 will peak the audio of the sound effects. PLEASE
USE DEFAULT VOLUME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
