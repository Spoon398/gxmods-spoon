Hi there, you're on the landing page for my Opera GX mod repo.

This repo serves as a storage hold for all of my mods here, and they can all be found under their respective folder on the repo.
Everything shown here is free to be cloned and added here if it is deemed necessary. Note: vandalism of this git will result in a permanent ban from contributing. 

Additional note: Any builds should be assumed as development builds, and are NOT for distribution on store.gx. Everything on this repo (as of right now) is my own work and publishing to store.GX may result in repurcussions. 

This is the main branch, and if something is pushed to a mod folder here (on the main branch), then expect a mod release/update soon.

Here's my currently developed mods that have been released:
Xbox 360 NXE (v3.1)

Here's some mods I'm currently working on that may or may not have folders here:
"Eggbully" (early stages)
"Big Bad Beaver" (Asset hunting)
"Owiebrainhurts" (early stages)
"Rythm" (working on assets)

# Xbox NXE Patch Notes for v3.1
- Nearly complete rewrite of the codebase handling everything behind the scenes
- Schema upgraded to V2 enabling GX Facelift features
- Additional optimizations to the new tab page
