Hi there, you're on the landing page for my Opera GX mod repo.
I store several of my mods here, and they can all be found under their respective folder on the repo.


# PATCH NOTES: XBOX 360 NXE v1.1
CHANGES
- New theme! Still tweaking it but it works lol
- Fixed sounds, but still inadvisable to have your sound effect volume set to 200% for any soound. Please use default volumes.
PLANNED UPDATES
- Animated new tab wallpaper based on the original Xbox 360 NXE Dashboard, with both a dark and light theme version.
- Tweaks to light mode.
- Tweaks to colors (they're not FULLY correct but I'm working on it)
- Background music. I have some tracks but they're not FULLY integrated yet.

Next version of the NXE mod is 2.0. I plan to have MOST of the features ironed out before a full release.
