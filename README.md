Hi there, you're on the landing page for my Opera GX mod repo.

This repo serves as a storage hold for all of my mods here, and they can all be found under their respective folder on the repo.

This is the main branch, and if something is pushed to a mod folder here (on the main branch), then expect a mod release/update soon.

Here's my currently developed mods that have been released:
Xbox 360 NXE (currently on v1.1.1)

# PATCH NOTES: XBOX 360 NXE v1.1.1
CHANGES
- New theme! Still tweaking it but it works lol
- Fixed sounds, but still inadvisable to have your sound effect volume set to 200% for any sound. Please use default or reduced volumes. (The upper limit is about 110% for peaking, specifically the tab open sound.)

PLANNED UPDATES
- Animated new tab wallpaper based on the original Xbox 360 NXE Dashboard, with both a dark and light theme version.
- Tweaks to light mode.
- Tweaks to colors (they're not FULLY correct but I'm working on it)
- Background music. I have some tracks (ripped from avatar editor) but they're not FULLY integrated yet.

Next version of the NXE mod is 2.0. I plan to have MOST of the features ironed out before a full release.
If you would like to contribute to this git or get more details on how I created some assets of this mod, or have some other general questions, please directly message "Spoon#5349" on Discord, or join https://discord.gg/2taWvdDqv2 , and I will respond ASAP.
(If the above invite doesn't work, message me directly.)
